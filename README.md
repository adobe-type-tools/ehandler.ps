# ehandler.ps

This open source project contains a PostScript error handler, which can be used to troubleshoot PostScript errors and other problems that occur when printing.

## Contents

This project includes only the *ehandler.ps* PostScript file, along with its accompanying open source license (*LICENSE.txt*).

## System Requirements

Any printer that includes Adobe PostScript Level 1, PostScript Level 2, or PostScript 3. To determine whether PostScript is included with your printer, see your printer's documentation or contact the manufacturer.

Once the PostScript error handler has been downloaded to your printer, it remains active in the printer's memory until the printer is switched off or restarted. The error handler affects only print jobs that produce PostScript errors &mdash; other print jobs are not affected by it.

## Getting Involved

Send suggestions for changes to the ehandler.ps project maintainer, [Dr. Ken Lunde](mailto:lunde@adobe.com?subject=[GitHub] ehandler.ps), for consideration.
